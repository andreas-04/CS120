For this lab you will be creating and testing a rectangle class. Rectangle objects should store 
the size of a rectangle and be able calculate things like the area and perimeter of 'themselves',
 and draw themselves as a series of *'s. For example,:
****
****
****
****
****
****
The rectangle class should have the following features:

    The class should have two private data members, a width and a height.
    A constructor function that sets the width and height of a rectangle to 0.
    A function that takes two integers as inputs and sets width and height of a rectangle object. 
    The function should check that both values are positive and if either value is negative make it
     positive. For example, if the user tries to set the height to -9, it's set to 9 instead. Zero
    values are acceptable.

    A print function that prints a rectangle object as:
    width = ...
    height = ...
    where ... has the correct value.
    A draw() function that draws the rectangle using *'s.
    An area() function that returns, but does not print, the area of a rectangle.
    An perimeter() function that returns, but does not print, the perimeter of a rectangle.

 

As an example, it should be possible to use the following code in main():
rectangle r1; // creates a rectangle object called r1
r1.set(4,6); // sets the height and width of the rectangle
cout << r1.perimeter() << endl; // should print the perimeter of the rectangle
int a = r1.area(); // should store the area of the rectangle in variable a, nothing is printed
r1.print(); // prints the height and width of the rectangle as described above
r1.draw(); // "draws" the rectangle with *'s as shown above

To test the rectangle class create at least three different rectangle objects and use them to test 
all of the above functions. Note that for the area() and perimeter() functions the main() function 
will need to print the results because they are not printed by the functions.
