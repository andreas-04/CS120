For this lab you will be creating a frame class The frame class is similar to our previous rectangle class, it should 
contain a width and a height and 'draw' frames:
****
*  *
*  *
*  *
****
This is 2 by 3 frame - note that the internal space is 2 wide by 3 high.

The class should have the following properties:

    Private data members to hold the width and height values.
    Three constructors. The first constructor takes no arguments and sets the width and height to both be one. The second 
    constructor takes one argument and makes a square frame with the given width and height. The third constructor takes 
    two arguments and sets the width to be the first value and the height to be the second value. If any of the given values 
    are less than one they are set to one.

    A set function that takes two arguments and sets the width and height. If either of the given values are less than 
    one they are set to one.

    A draw() function that 'draws' a frame as shown above.

 

Your program must use this frame.cpp file as the main program without any changes. Your final class must work with this 
main() file. However, for testing purposes you may want to temporarily comment out some of the main() file.

Your rectangle class must be written in a file called frame.h so that it will load properly.

Your rectangle class may not get any input from the user.

The output of your program should be exactly as shown in this file.

Turn in: A copy of the program and sample output showing it runs. As always, if you cannot finish all of the functionality 
turn in as much as you complete - as long as your code compiles and runs.
