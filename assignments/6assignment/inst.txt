    Add a new, numeric data member to the pet class. It could be health, money, tiredness, etc. Modify the existing interaction functions (play()
    and feed()) to also affect this new data member. For example, playing with a pet makes it healthier or more tired.

    Add a new interaction function that changes the new data member. For example, you can have your pet nap() to change tiredness. 
    This function could change other data members, e.g. nap() decreases tiredness, but increases hunger.

    Modify the print() function so that instead of simply printing the pet's data values it uses if statements to also print appropriate messages. 
    For example, if the pet's hunger value is high (where you pick high) it prints a message about being hungry. You can make the message general 
    "Your pet is hungry." or make it seem like it comes from the pet "I'm hungry :( feed me please." Include at least 6 different messages for different 
    ranges of hungry and happy.

    Change the feed() member function so that it prints different messages randomly. The function will need to generate a random number in some range 
    and then use that number (and if or switch statements) to pick which message to print.
